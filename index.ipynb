You learned that you get a result very close to the mathematical solution when using random sampling. This difference is due to randomness, and as your sample size grows you'll see that the difference becomes very small! For more complex problems with larger datasets, having an understanding of the underlying probabilities can help you solve a lot of optimization problems as you'll learn later."
